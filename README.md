Geant simulation for a Deuterium-Deuterium (DD) Time of Flight (ToF) experiment which is to calibrate Liquid Xenon (LXe) with ~ 300 keV neutrons. A set of very advanced and useful coding techniques has been developed to enable visualizing the events simulated on a cluster. To obtain enough statistics, simulation need to be run on a cluster which has thousands of cores; while Geant can't support visualization well on a Linux cluster. A local Mac machine can visualize events well but can't run high statistics simulation due to limited cores. Visualization is very helpful to understand the track of simulated events. My solution is to assign a unique seeds number array (like an ID) for each event simulated on a cluster, then visualize the events on a local PC by feeding the seeds number array. For example, by analyzing the high statistics simulated results accomplished on a cluster, I found one interesting event and want to know its trajectory, I can look at its seeds numbers then feed them into the script on my local Mac and see its trajectory clearly.
This script can run successfully under Geant4.10.3.3.
